# Chicken Crossing

Inspired by the classic Atari chicken game, I recreated a unique version for two players. The main objective is to cross to the other side of the street as many times as possible within 1 minute while cars pass at random speeds on 6 lanes, 3 going to the right and 3 to the left. At the end of the countdown, the player with the highest score wins.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay:** This game is designed for two players to compete against each other to cross the street as many times as possible.
- **Car Traffic:** Cars pass on 6 lanes, 3 going to the right and 3 to the left, at random speeds.
- **Time Limit:** The game lasts 1 minute. After this time, the countdown ends and the final score is calculated.
- **Score Counting:** Each time a player successfully crosses the street, they earn points. The final score is determined by the number of times each player crossed the street.
- **Simple Graphics:** Using the Pygame library, the game features simple yet effective graphics.
